<title>Introduction</title>

<p>Weaving that is considered here is what can be realized with a loom such as the one shown in <xref ref="fig-loom"/>.
The main topics are </p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>an exposition of how the weaver's draft, consisting of a tie plan, pedaling matrix and lift plan can
		 be combined to visualize the final weave that will be produced, and</p></li>
		<li><p>an analysis of how harnesses can be tied in such a way to realize a given weave pattern.</p></li>
	</ul>
<subsection xml:id="ss-weaving-def">
<title>Weaving Basics</title><index><main>Weaving Basics</main></index>

<p>A weave pattern is created by interleaving two sets of parallel lengths of fiber. Each of the fibers in one set, the <term>warp</term>, is connected to exactly one of \(n\) harnesses, \(n \geq 2\). Each <term>harness</term> will lift the threads that are connected to it.  A series of pedals are connected to the harnesses, with each pedal connected to between 1 and <m>n-1</m> of the harnesses. When a pedal is pressed, the warp fibers connected to that pedal through the harnesses are lifted, forming a <term>shed</term> between the warp fibers that are lifted and those that are not lifted. A <term>weft</term> thread can then be passed through the shed.  The weft runs perpendicular to the warp. Normally, the weft thread is passed through the shed with a <term>shuttle</term>. </p>

<p>By performing a sequence of pedal presses and shuttle passes that interleave the warp with the weft, a weaving pattern is realized.  Using different colors for the warp and weft makes the pattern visible. In this discussion we only consider "monochromatic weaving." </p>
</subsection>
<subsection xml:id="ss-weaving-draft">
<title>The Weaver's Draft</title>
<p>A weaver's draft is typically a array of four matrices, such as the small example in <xref ref="fig-draft" autoname="yes" />. The top left (A) matrix, called the harness matrix, has as many columns as the number of warp threads, and there is a row for each harness.  Each column indicates which harness to which the corresponding thread is tied. Each thread is tied to only one harness and so each column has one mark.  The top right (B) matrix, called the pedal matrix, indicates which harnesses are tied to each pedal and determines which threads will make up the top of the shed when a pedal is pressed.  The bottom right (C) matrix is the lift plan, which indicates the sequence of pedal presses that are to performed for each successive weft thread.  The output from is sequence of presses and shuttle movements is indicated with the bottom left (D) matrix, the weave.  Some weavers use different  positioning schemes in their drafts, but the essential information is the same.  </p>

</subsection>
<subsection>
   <title>Computing the weave pattern</title>
<p>Clearly the weaver has control over the harness matrix, pedal matrix and lift plan.   It is a simple matter of logic to determine whether any weft thread will lie above or below any warp thread.  In <xref ref="section-products" autoname="yes"/> we derive formulas to determine the whole weave based on matrix multiplication.</p>
</subsection>
 <subsection>
   <title>Realization of a Weave</title>
<p>An even more practical question is how to specify the harness matrix, pedal matrix and lift plan to attain a specific weave pattern, if at all possible for a given loom.  In <xref ref="section-realization" autoname="yes"/>, we give a description of how to determine whether one can  realize a desired weave pattern and how the loom can be set to do so.</p>
</subsection>
</section>
<!-- 
Given a collection of subsets of some set, their minsets are the atoms which cannot be divided by standard set operations. Minsets hold the key to how the harnesses of a loom should be threaded in order to realize a weave pattern, and to determine whether the pattern can even be realized with a specific loom. 


We number the warp threads left to right with the numbers 1 to w, and the harnesses with numbers 0 through n-1.

The simplest weave case is a two harness arrangement where warp thread k is connected to harness k mod 2. If each of two pedals are connected to the two harnesses, and pedals are alternated, the result is a "plain weave."  There are two different lift patterns here. 

Figure here. 


Fundamental question:  given a weave pattern with a certain set of lift patterns and look with a number available harnesses and pedals, is it possible to realize the pattern with that loom?

Whether a pattern can be realized is determined by whether each of the distinct horizontal rows of the pattern can be realized. Let r1...rn be those rows. Each row ri is realized be lifting a set Ri of warp fibers. Give two warp fibers f1 and f2, if f1,f2 \in Ri for some i yet f1 \in Rj while f2 \notin Rj, we cannot connect f1 and f2 to the same harness.   If we presume that all warp fibers are connected to exactly one harness, with the set of warp fibers connected to harness i equal to Hi, then the warp fibers lifted to realize a row must be a union of the 
Hi's. These observations imply that {Hi} would be the minsets generated by {Ri}:

Hi = \intersect{j=1}{n}
