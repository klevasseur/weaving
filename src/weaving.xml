<p>This article highlights some of the mathematics behind weaving. Weaving that is considered here is what can be realized with a multi-harness loom such as the one shown in <xref ref="fig-loom" autoname="yes" />.  The main topics are </p>
<p>	<ul>
		<li><p>an exposition of how the weaver's draft, consisting of a tie-up draft, treadlig matrix and lift plan can
		 be combined to visualize the final weave that will be produced, and</p></li>
		<li><p>an analysis of how harnesses can be tied in such a way to realize a given weave pattern.</p></li>
	</ul></p>
 <p>This is an outgrowth of two projects. The first was work with Shelley Rasmussen and students in the UMass Lowell Co-op Scholar program.  Students Mary Mersereau, Olivia Demers, and Matt D'Angelo developed materials that linked weaving with mathematics.  The second is <em>Lowell Tex</em>, a collaboration between UMass Lowell faculty and local textile artists to develop STEM-related teaching materials.  I'd like to thank Chriztine Foltz, a Lowell Tex collaborator, for helping me out with proper weaving terminology and loom photos.</p>
</introduction>
<section xml:id="s-weaving-def">
<title>Weaving Basics</title><index><main>Weaving Basics</main></index>

<introduction><p>A weave pattern is created by interleaving two sets of parallel lengths of fiber. Each of the fibers in one set, the <term>warp</term>, is connected to exactly one of \(n\) harnesses, \(n \geq 2\). Each <term>harness</term> will lift the threads that are connected to it.  A series of <term>treadles</term> are connected to the harnesses, with each treadle connected to between 1 and <m>n-1</m> of the harnesses. When a treadle is pressed, the warp fibers connected to that treadle through the harnesses are lifted, forming a <term>shed</term> between the warp fibers that are lifted and those that are not lifted. A <term>weft</term> thread can then be passed through the shed.  The weft runs perpendicular to the warp. Normally, the weft thread is passed through the shed with a <term>shuttle</term>. </p>

<p>By performing a sequence of treadle presses and shuttle passes that interleave the warp with the weft, a weaving pattern is realized on fabric.  Using different colors for the warp and weft makes the pattern visible. In this discussion we only consider "monochromatic weaving," where the warp are all of one color and the weft threads are all of a second color.</p>
</introduction>
<subsection xml:id="s-weaving-draft">
<title>The Weaver's Draft</title>
<p>A weaver's draft is typically a array of four matrices, such as the small example in <xref ref="fig-draft" autoname="yes" />. The top left (A) matrix, called the harness draft, has as many columns as the number of warp threads, and there is a row for each harness.  Each column indicates to which harness the corresponding thread is tied. Each thread is tied to only one harness and so each column has one mark.  The top right (B) matrix, called the <term>treadling plan</term>, indicates which harnesses are tied to each treadle and determines which threads will make up the top of the shed when a treadle is pressed. The treadling plan has as many rows as there are harnesses and as many columns as there are treadles.  The bottom right (C) matrix is the lift plan, which indicates the sequence of treadle presses that are to be performed, one for each successive weft thread. The lift plan has as many columns as there are treadles.  The number of rows is the number of weft threads.   The lift plan is frequently periodic and the rows on the draft could be repeated. The output from this sequence of presses and shuttle movements is indicated with the bottom left (D) matrix, the weave.  Some weavers use different  positioning schemes in their drafts, but the essential information is the same.  </p>

</subsection>
<subsection>
   <title>Computing the weave pattern</title>
<p>Clearly the weaver has control over the harness matrix, treadle matrix and lift plan.   It is a simple matter of logic to determine whether any weft thread will lie above or below any warp thread.  In <xref ref="s-products" autoname="yes"/> we derive formulas to determine the whole weave based on matrix multiplication.</p>
<p>Not every draft will produce a weave that "hangs together."  A trivial example would be a draft for which one of the warp threads is always on the upper part of the shed, which would leave that thread to <q>float.</q>  Less obvious cases can arise however.  We will describe how this condition can be determined from the output matrix.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection>
   <title>Realization of a Weave</title>
<p>An even more practical question is how to specify the harness matrix, treadle matrix and lift plan to attain a specific weave pattern, if at all possible for a given loom.  In <xref ref="section-realization" autoname="yes"/>, we give a description of how to determine whether one can  realize a desired weave pattern and how the loom can be set to do so.</p>
