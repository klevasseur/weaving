A weaving draft is a block array with the stucture

\(\begin{array}{|c|c|}
\hline
 H & P \\
\hline
 W & L \\
\hline
\end{array}\)

where \(H, T, W \text{and} L\) { }are boolean matrices defined as follows\\
$\quad $

\textit{ H} is the harness matrix it has as many rows as a loom has harnesses andas many columns as the number of warp threads. { }We define entries
of this matrix by\\
$\quad \quad $\(H_{i j \unicode{0008}}= \text{Is} \text{harness} i \text{connected} \text{to} \text{warp} \text{thread} j?\)

\textit{ P} is the pedal matrix it has as many rows as a loom has harnesses and as many columns as the pedals in the loom. { }We define entries of
this matrix by\\
$\quad \quad $\(P_{i j \unicode{0008}}= \text{Is} \text{harness} i \text{lifted} \text{by} \text{pedal} j?\)

\textit{ L} is the lift plan matrix it has as many rows as the number of threads in the weft and as many columns as the number of pedals in the loom.
{ }We define entries of this matrix by\\
$\quad \quad $\(L_{i j \unicode{0008}}= \text{Is} \text{pedal} j \text{pressed} \text{for} \text{tread} i?\)

\textit{ W }is the matrix of the weave resulting from the setting of \textit{ H}, \textit{ P}, and \textit{ L. { }}We derive \textit{ W} as a matrix
product in terms of these settings.\\
$\quad \quad $\(W_{i j}=\text{Is} \text{warp} \text{thead} j \text{lifted} \text{above} \text{weft} \text{thread} i?\)

We claim that \(W = L T^tH\) , where \(T^t\) is the transpose of \textit{ T.}

To demonstrate our claim we define the matrix \textit{ C} where\\
$\quad $\(C_{i j}= \text{Is} \text{warp} \text{thead} j \text{lifted} \text{when} \text{pedal} i \text{is} \text{pressed}?\\
\\
= P_{1i}H_{1j }+P_{2i}H_{2j }+\cdots \\
\\
\quad =H^t{}_{j 1}P_{1 i}+H^t{}_{j 2}P_{2 i} +\cdots \\
\\
\quad =\left(H^tP\right){}_{j i}\\
\\
\quad = \left(H^tP\right)^t{}_{i j}\\
\\
\quad = \left(T^tH\right){}_{i j}\)

Now we can compute \textit{ W:\\
$\quad $}\(W_{i j}= \text{Is} \text{warp} \text{thead} j \text{lifted} \text{above} \text{weft} \text{thread} i?\\
\\
= L_{i 1}C_{1j }+ L_{i 2}C_{2j }+\cdots \\
\\
= (L C)_{i j}\\
\\
= \left(L T^tH\right){}_{i j}\)i
